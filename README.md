Features
Automated watering based on soil moisture levels.
Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
Customizable watering schedules.
Mobile app integration for remote monitoring and control.
Water usage analytics to track and optimize water consumption.
Components
Microcontroller: Arduino or Raspberry Pi for controlling the system.
Sensors: Soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor.
Actuators: Solenoid valves or water pumps for irrigation.
Communication Module: WiFi or Bluetooth module for connectivity.
Power Supply: Solar panels or batteries for off-grid operation.
Enclosure: Weatherproof enclosure to protect electronics.
Installation
Hardware Setup: Connect sensors, actuators, and microcontroller according to the circuit diagram.
